# Virgin-Galactic-OpenFOAM-Simulation
OpenFOAM simulation of flow over virgin galactic aircraft
OpenFOAM makes use of C++ to run CFD simulations. 
The files included are the 0 file, System and Constant 

The 0 File includes all initial conditions
System includes all solvers, schemes and meshing techniques 
constant contains the mesh and geometry 

OpenFOAM is needed to run this.
